Now, I am motivated to experience the process of design, be creative and learn more about research.

Coming to complete an undergraduate Engineering degree was a way I could build a breadth of knowledge that could help me if pursuing a career in academia or industry.  Thus, there was also a sizeable amount of indecisiveness that contributed to my decision, as contradictory as that may sound.

During my travels and employment, I greatly missed the rigor of schoolwork and the stimulation that comes with an invigorating academic environment; although I pursued self-driven studies during this time, the lack of a like-minded community served to make the experience intellectually isolating rather than engaging. I prefer to be in situations where I am forced to reexamine myself and outgrow my limitations, despite feeling out of my depth at times-- once I'm comfortable in an environment, I no longer feel that I'm in the right place. While travelling and supporting myself did provide the opportunity to redraw some of my personal boundaries, I feel that the challenges presented by university offer the greatest potential for personal growth at this point in my life.
As for my choice of degree-- while my interests lie in the conceptual, I personally feel unfulfilled unless my actions have a direct, beneficial impact on the lives of others. I've always been interested in the interplay between theory and practice, especially regarding how we (humans) approach problems of all kinds (social, ethical, environmental, analytical, physical)-- Engineering Science ostensibly engages with this idea directly and therefore seemed like the most appealing program to me.

However, it took a long time before I realized that an undergraduate degree in engineering was best suited for me.

Initially, I thought about taking a pure science university program, but I eventually realized that while some sciences would allow you to apply what you learn to real-life scenarios (such as food science), many other programs were more geared towards research with few chances to apply your knowledge to help others.
In addition, I had seriously considered pursuing music at university, which is one of my greatest passions.

During my application process, once thing that constantly deterred me from other fields of studies was the lack of range and depth covered in each of the courses they offered. I wanted to be able to be well educated in all aspects of learning. I don't believe certain subjects are more important than others (ex. physics over biology), but rather believe that an understanding of all subjects is what creates well rounded students capable of tackling all sorts of problems. This, in the end, is what drew me to engineering (or eng sci in particular). I want to be able to come out of this program with a well rounded knowledge set, so I know that in the future, I'll have the tools to tackle what ever problems are thrown at me. If I could live on this earth forever, I'd try and learn everything the world has to offer, and use that knowledge to 1. solve the most unreachable problems, 2. push innovation to its limits, and 3. help my community become the best place it could possibly be.

I chose to become an engineer over anything else because I saw it as the best way to both incorporate my existing soft skills as a communicator and creative-thinker with my hard skills and passion for studying science, technology, and mathematics. Studying engineering would be a way for me to use all of my skills together while refining them with the right mindset. 

EngSci is a difficult major and I took it up because I have the drive to take on such endeavors to challenge and push myself to become both well-rounded and highly skilled in certain areas so I can maximise my abilities as an engineer in the future.","Being able to put theory into action and keep discovering, inventing, and changing to improve and refine the way we live.","Standing out from both my peers and from the general population, for having an extremely strong work-ethic, perseverance, talent, leadership, creativity, and willingness to learn",Having a highly-specialised profession in an ever-advancing industry,,GA04,GA02,GA01,GA06,GA12,GA05,GA07,GA03,GA10,GA09,GA08,GA11,GA04,GA02,GA06,GA01,GA07,GA08,GA05,GA09,GA10,GA11,GA03,GA12,GA01,GA04,GA05,GA02,GA06,GA07,GA09,GA11,GA10,GA08,GA03,GA12,Y,Y

Now, my interest in ""science"" has narrowed down to mostly just physics. The concepts in math and physics just seem to make sense to me a lot better and a lot faster than concepts in other subjects. My interest in these subjects ultimately made it clear to me that I wanted to become an engineer.

Since I want to pursue aerospace engineering, I was somewhat limited in the options I had for post-graduate studies. All major aerospace-oriented companies (such as NASA, ESA, etc.), as well as minor aerospace-oriented companies, require a degree in aerospace or mechanical engineering. Furthermore, a graduate degree significantly increases the chances of employment in the aerospace industry. Therefore, to reach my goal, my best option was to come to an aerospace/mechanical engineering program where I could learn a lot as well as get the opportunity to get some in-field experience.","Becoming a part of society, hopefully leaving a significant impact on the world",Being able to support my family in the future,"Going to work everyday because I love what I do, not because I must do it",,GA09,GA12,GA10,GA03,GA06,GA04,GA02,GA01,GA05,GA07,GA08,GA11,GA01,GA08,GA07,GA05,GA02,GA04,GA03,GA06,GA11,GA12,GA10,GA09,GA04,GA03,GA01,GA05,GA02,GA07,GA06,GA10,GA09,GA08,GA12,GA11,Y,Y

In high school, I loved biology, physics, art, and math. I wanted to enter a field that would not only make me employable, but would let me continue to grow as an individual. I sought out a program that would challenge me, yet ultimately be rewarding and (hopefully) allow me to make a difference in the lives of others. I considered both the healthcare field and the engineering field.
I ended up at St. Clair College where I completed a three-year advanced diploma in Biomedical Engineering Technology. Throughout this program, I discovered that I love the biomedical field, but I would prefer to design new technologies rather than service current medical devices. In pursuit of this goal I applied to Engineering Science at the University of Toronto and hope to specialize in the biomedical field.

The employment numbers for an engineer aren't too bad either ;)
However, engineering is a professional degree for a reason - it is meant to prepare students for the workplace straight after university (very practical). Unfortunately, my thought process does tend to be more theoretical, and I find theories to be much more interesting than concrete information (wow, after reading what I just wrote maybe pure science really is a better match for me, lol). Anyways, EngSci was a nice option that sufficiently combined both theory and practice: I would be able to pursue the theory-based learning I desired, and at the same time sharpen my practical reasoning skills.

In retrospect, the basis of this life decision sounds weak; however, I genuinely like school, so I want to continue to pursue academics, and university is where I can do that.

I am interested in math, science, visual and digital art, and literature. However, I elected STEM courses over art courses in high school, as STEM programs have strict prerequisites while art programs are more flexible. This action eventually lead me to decide on pursuing STEM post-secondary, because the more I learn about STEM, the more eager I am to learn more. Employment and financial security is also an important factor in my decision to pursue engineering. My family exhausted most of their financial resources to immigrate to Canada, and as a result, I need to earn decent money for my family to really settle in this country, so that my younger siblings can chase their dreams.

But truth be told, I kind of take pride in the program that I am in in the sense that being an engsci gives me an identity of superiority despite knowing how challenging the workload will turn out to be, so it may seem that my decision-making process in terms of programs was biased,which makes me realize this kind of mindset is immature, unhealthy, and somewhat reckless. But on the other hand, I do prefer trying in the hardest than coasting in my comfort zone without having to attempt at all. 
In a nut shell, I picked this program because I want to be one of the best and experience the best undergraduate journey I could possibly find, so it is kind of my ambition that is reluctant to accept the inferior, the less prestigious and the normal due to my always desire to be different from the others. Although the question of whether I am the material to be in the best program still remains to be seen, in the mean time, I assure myself that I will try my best to keep up with the pace, and that is all I can do for now. 
I have set my mind on making my experience academically here at uoft or any institutes the most fulfilling and worthy of the price I paid to be here, as I see engsci as something that is suitable to me. I am a person who is a bit hard to adapt new system and tends to be a little stuck at my past, so another critical reason is the fact that engsci has two foundational years, as me being indecisive, that in a way offers me a buffer time before actually entering a new phase of my academics. I like the uniqueness present in engsci which renders me distinctive and my life more meaningful. 
Consequentially, my biggest motivation here at engsci is being different and somewhat superior not just to engineering but all the others with engineering being the most difficult to get in, and also, my inclination to never say I am being defeated academically, if people could successfully pass engsci, and I believe so can I, as not only do I want to prove to myself but also my parents that I will accomplish something no matter how insurmountable as long as I try my best because I am capable of greater things!","I am not letting my parents down, as they are the most precious people in the world of mine",Knowing I am getting somewhere and constantly making progress so I will okay on the path I am onto right now,"Feeling somewhat superior and different, standing out in a way that distinguishes myself from the others",,GA02,GA01,GA04,GA03,GA05,GA07,GA06,GA11,GA12,GA08,GA09,GA10,GA02,GA07,GA11,GA06,GA04,GA03,GA01,GA08,GA09,GA10,GA05,GA12,GA02,GA04,GA01,GA07,GA03,GA06,GA05,GA11,GA12,GA09,GA08,GA10,Y,Y

Growing up, I have also developed an interest in science, and technology. From elementary school through high school, math has always been one of my favorite subjects as well. In high school, I was fully introduced to science, where I received the lowest grade I had ever received in my grade 9 science class. After that experience, I was motivated to try harder in science class, where I loved gaining a deeper understanding of the content (as well as getting higher grades). This experience led me to continue taking science courses through my high school experience. Also, I took piano lessons when I was younger, where I used a mechanical metronome. I was very curious as to how the metronome worked, which I will admit, distracted me at times when I was trying to practice. Many incidents like this one occurred, as I have always been fascinated by moving things, more specifically technology. Overall, throughout my life experiences, I have developed an interest in math, science, and technology, therefore chose engineering as it is a combination of the 3. 

Furthermore, I was actually going to pursue a future in the computer science path, however, was drawn to Engineering Science as a program. I am attracted to the way it is structured, as I have 2 years to gain knowledge of all the different types of engineering to really discover what I am most interested in.

So in order to continue learning and expanding my knowledge, I choose to take the path of post-secondary education. I have always found that concepts relating to science and math are ones that I am able to understand quite easily. Despite my best efforts, this has not always been the case for subjects such as Business or English (especially essay writing). Furthermore, the process of approaching a problem and analyzing it in an attempt to solve the problem is one I find quite enriching. Additionally, the lightbulb moments that come along during the process are quite rewarding. I find that Engineering fits my interests the most as it combines mathematical and scientific concepts to solve problems on the daily basis. For this reason, I choose Engineering as opposed to another program. ","To show myself that I am capable of things that I might not always believe I am.

I really want to have experience working in a foreign country as I enjoy travelling and I feel that engineering is a global pursuit that could guide me towards this goal. The salaries of engineers also interested me as the starting salary for engineers is higher than for other programs. A big motivation for completing an engineering undergrad was the lack of need for completing further education as one can enter the industry after completing their undergraduate degree. Additionally, I enjoy the fact that engineering can be applied to be more artistic fields such as the cosmetics industry. It has the ability to be applied to many fields making it a great backup for any job or further education. 
I chose to do engineering over other paths as I wanted to continue to expand my scientific knowledge and innovation. Additionally, I feel that the other pathways can still be explored later in life without set back or consequences. Whereas to immediately gain an entry level industry position one needs a degree and it would be beneficial to have one earlier. 
I chose engineering over other programs because of the opportunities it provides over other programs and degrees as I outlined above.

University felt the most secure and safe path to follow through for now due to the high reputation that the University of Toronto offers and the fact that I am still not 100 percent sure of what I want to do in the future. I was unsure of whether I wanted to choose life sciences  or engineering as my program choice, but I eventually made the decision of choosing engineering. I do not have a lot of preference in terms of the content in these two very different program choices. The reason I chose engineering over life science was because although I was fairly confident that I would be accepted into medical school, I still knew there would be a risk factor going down that path if I had not gotten accepted into medical school. I was not confident of being superior over others in the field of medicine. However, I have always been able to confidently express myself better than most others in engineering related courses.

Engineering is one of the few paths through which a small group of individuals can positively affect the lives of many, as exemplified by projects such as the hand-powered blood centrifuge developed by a Stanford professor. Also, my interests and aptitudes are suited most strongly to engineering rather than other methods of creating change such as politics or business. Specifically, my fascination with science, math, and design as well as my logical problem-solving style fits well with engineering, while my relatively reserved personality does not lend itself to influencing others through politics and business.

Besides the somewhat lofty motivation listed above, I also greatly enjoy the process of learning about the world and designing solutions to problems. Simply put, engineering is one of the most fun activities that I have participated in, from learning from my father the way circuits worked to building robots for various competitions. While I do want to use engineering as a way to make an impact in the world, I would not have chosen it if I did not think that I would enjoy it the way that I do.

Finally, I also chose engineering as a way to develop myself into a well-rounded person.

As I am extremely indecisive, I definitely didn't have a clear enough idea of what I want to do to attempt anything related to entrepreneurship, and even college seemed to be too restricting, both because less positions are open to college graduates than university graduates and because college would only have been 2 years rather than 4 (or 5 with PEY). Still on the same idea of indecision, I have always loved math and physics, but I am also interested in some of the social sciences that examine more of a human interaction and policy aspect, such as law or international relations. I had briefly considered engineering, but honestly thought it was nothing more than building bridges, buildings and cars and programming computers. These first options simply didn't interest me, and the last one is something I know absolutely nothing about, so I was worried about trying to build a career out of it. However, out of a lack of knowledge of what else to do with math and physics, I applied to engineering anyways. After this, I got to know more about the different aspects of it through the university's various applicant events and information sessions. This really helped make my decision, because that's where I realized that an engineering degree is actually applicable to so many different fields and careers due to the transferable nature of all the soft skills that are essential whether I decide to pursue law, a master's degree in engineering, a career in research, or really anything else.

Furthermore, I'm really interested in the theoretical aspect of math and physics, and so I chose EngSci because this program focuses heavily on theory, as opposed to just practical/Engineering-related skills (which I'm also interested in learning about as well). An engineering program would also allow me to gain many useful communication, professional, and practical skills, which will be useful regardless of whatever field I intend to pursue in the future (a science degree would focus less on these skills).

In high school, I found physics and calculus to be so interesting and intriguing, and I knew that I wanted to continue studying them at university in some way.

Engineering appeals to me because it requires innovation. In high school, I was first introduced to this through design challenges and contests. I thought it was so fun and challenging to approach problems from unique angles and try and come up with previously unthought of ways to approach an situation. This is what lead me to gravitate towards engineering instead of the sciences (I.e. a physics major).

As an engineer, you also have the ability to make an impact on people’s lives and help with the world’s biggest problems. The idea of making a positive contribution to the world in this way really appealed to me as well.

Engineering was actually not the only course of study I considered. Throughout high school, I studied classical voice (opera singing) with the initial intention of pursuing a performance program at university or studying at the conservatory. In Grade 12, I applied to both EngSci and the Faculty of Music’s voice performance program. I was accepted by both, and had to make an immensely difficult decision. I chose Engineering Science for the reasons above.

The opportunity to take several courses through the Faculty of Music with the engineering music performance minor also contributed greatly to my decision. I think that allowing engineering students to pursue studies in music is a really great idea.

After extensive research, speaking to the Dean of Engineering at U of T, and shadowing many engineering students, my choice became clear. The combination of mechanical, electrical, systems design, and computer courses offered by Engineering Science provided an interdisciplinary education that is highly integrated and focused. The curriculum offers the exact technical and theoretical background I need to create innovative machines and systems that will change the world.

I greatly enjoyed the experience of working in a team to accomplish a design goal in a very short period of time. I have fairly strong skills in chemistry, physics and math and hence felt like my skills supported my interest in engineering from robotics. While I have wavered at points (most notably while working as an intern at a tech company which had similar aspects to an engineering job and I found that I didn't love the internship), I have since realised that I really value the teamwork aspect. Working alone is simply not as interesting to me and I don't feel as much pressure to deliver, so it's reassuring that normally engineers work in some sort of team. I also chose to pursue engineering due to my parents both doing their degrees as engineers, so it's been the ""safe choice"" for me for quite some time. Regardless, I definitely valued the ability to work across a range of high performing fields with engineering science specifically, compared to the confines of many ArtSci degrees and even other engineering schools.",Successfully completing a team project with people who I would count as friends.,Using engineering to travel and help others worldwide ,The ability to have a solid base (job/income) on which to try new things (activities/volunteering/personal things) from,,GA06,GA09,GA01,GA07,GA02,GA04,GA03,GA10,GA12,GA08,GA11,GA05,GA07,GA06,GA04,GA01,GA11,GA08,GA02,GA03,GA10,GA09,GA12,GA05,GA01,GA02,GA03,GA04,GA09,GA06,GA07,GA10,GA11,GA08,GA05,GA12,Y,Y

I have participated in the program for four years, and despite being relatively introverted and shy, made many friends and had a great time participating in it. This inspired me to pursue engineering. In grade 11, I had discovered another thing that interested me greatly, which was physics. I wasn't necessarily the strongest physics or math student, but seeing mathematics explain the world seemed fantastic to me. After doing an essay on terminal velocity, I had greater respect for math as an analytical tool. Ultimately, this led me to pursue engineering science over a physics degree or a normal engineering degree, due to the combination of science and engineering.

I also found engineering science's breadth requirements appealing. I think learning a lot is important in today's age. A lot of engineering solutions now require mechanical, electrical, computer, etc knowledge to develop something. Robots are a good example of this. This inspired me to choose engineering science over ECE since I wanted to get a bigger picture view of how these complex systems, and the fundamental principles behind them (i.e. the science).

Another thing that made me choose engineering over physics was employment prospects. I don't think I wanted to pursue a pHD, and I was confident I wasn't genius level in it, so I decided that getting an engineering degree was safer than a physics degree. The harder maths also worries me since I'm not particularly strong at the proof aspects of math. I chose engineering over computer science because I still wanted to get a physical background, and learn a lot about a variety of fields, which I felt engineering did better over computer science. 

I chose engineering over other career pathways because as I've mentioned before, I wanted to learn the underlying theory of many principles and create tools used by people, rather than just use tools. I also felt that an engineering degree would help me pursue research to help people or entrepreneurship (in the tech industry) should I desire to do that.

I knew that one of the ways to do this was to become a critical problem solver. Since engineering incorporates this mentality through the application of mathematics and science, I knew engineering was the right path for me.

I chose this program specifically AND this part of my life specifically  to pursue becoming an authority on the future of the industry to effect change, and imagine the future.

It's not only about the knowledge and facts we learn of sciences and math, but also more on how to make use of what we have learnt, on making a network of our knowledge and use it as a tool. 

The main reason that I chose Eng Sci is that I am interested in the Aerospace stream and besides that, I still want to discover other directions of engineering, and the two general years of our program provide me the opportunity to learn more, to have a wider understanding of engineering as a whole, and possibly, enable me to lead a group of engineers specialized in different areas in the future. To be realistic here for a moment, engineers do get decent salary payments and good employment opportunities; and I can pursue an MBA afterwards (or any other business certificates) with a Bachelor of Engineering, but not too easy to do the other way around.

First of all, I come from a culture that values intelligence and academic success and  where going to (a prestigious) University is not only the norm, but an expectation. In many ways, attending University after graduating High School personally felt like the “natural” order of things. Besides, University offers what I look for in an education : intellectual stimulation. Heavy theory doesn’t faze me because I genuinely enjoy having to put in a lot of effort in order to understand hard concepts. 
Similarly, I chose Engineering for many reasons. For one, I love physics and maths and the first two years of EngSci will definitely deliver. Moreover, having an Engineering degree is a much safer choice than a degree in Maths or Physics since the demand for Engineers on the market is usually stable. Additionally, I love the whole design aspect of Engineering; as a child, I would spend hours playing with legos and creating intricate models. Finally, Engineering gives me the opportunity to work in both the industry and in the research field, a flexibility that few other degrees offers.

However, a close second is the fields of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, and an undergraduate degree in Engineering, if I am able to complete it and/or don't decide to switch out, provides me with a practical degree that opens up a wide range of fields that I can apply these concepts, something I can't do with many other degrees, especially those fields I am interested in. This is the primary motivation for my choice, and perhaps I might not go through with it. But I am confident that gaining the practical experience and the flexibility that an undergraduate degree in engineering provides (and that I have seen many times in my personal relationships with engineers) would never be detrimental to me, either from a personal development POV, or a financial security POV.

I grew up surrounded by engineers; my father and two brothers are engineers and I can see how they think and react to different situations. Furthermore, engineering students tend to have higher job prospects as well. I’m additionally the founder of International Environment Friends Society, and thus I believe being an engineer will enable me to leave a difference in the society. I want the world to become more sustainable by empowering the youth of today to become the confident leaders of tomorrow.

I was merely attracted to the idea of learning and working hard every day. As weird as it sounds, I get a rewarding feeling when I finish studying even if it is late at night. In all truthfulness, I could have gone for either visual arts or mathematics; however, I was afraid that I would get too bored in those areas, so I picked a program that is not just challenging, but can also cover areas that I am generally good and not good at. I also quit my job as soon as I entered the program because I wanted to give all my focus to this program. One thing I also really like is the idea of competitiveness.
